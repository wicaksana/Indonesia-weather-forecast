Visualization of weather forecast for cities in Indonesia using data from BMKG

Recently, I found out that BMKG publish some of their data publicly (see http://data.bmkg.go.id/). One particular type of dataset which interests me is their XML-based daily weather forecast for cities in Indonesia (propinsi_xx_xx.xml). In this project, I am planning to develop web-based visualization of the forecast based on those data. I am going to use AngularJS, D3.js, and either googlemap or openstreetmap.

As always: create the repository first, and then God knows when this project will be finished (or even started!).
